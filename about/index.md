Hi, I am a third year Undergraduate Student of **Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur**, enrolled in its Integrated M.Sc Course in **Mathematics and Computing**.

I am a developer. I love to solve problems. I spend most of my time hooked up to my ultrabook, watching stuff on youtube, browsing the web, and reading reviews.

## My day is all about:

* Learning.
* Living in the moment.
* Observing small things.
* Making new friends and gaining new experience with them.
