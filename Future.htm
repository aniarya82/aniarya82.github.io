		<h2> My Ambition </h2>
		<div id="mainContent">
			<p> One of my greatest goals in life is to become a Data Analyst. I know I will be able to do this because I have the ambition and drive it takes to accomplish this. The reasoning for me wanting to become a Data Analyst is that I have a passion of rendering data from different places and process it into a meaningful entity.
			<br /> Analysis of data is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, in different business, science, and social science domains.
			<br /> According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) financial analysts made a median hourly rate of $35.75, or $74,350 annually in 2010. Market research analysts made $29.12 an hour, or $60,570 annually, and operations research analysts made $34.12 per hour, or $70,960 annually.
			<br />Most analysts will have degrees in fields like math, statistics, computer science, or something closely related to their field. Strong math and analysis skills are needed. I get an plus here since I am already in Mathemathics stream.
