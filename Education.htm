		<h2> What Education Means to Me </h2>
		<div id="mainContent">
			<p>Education is one of the most important aspects in my life. I work my hardest during school so that I am successful when I grow up. My goal is to be an independent man and to reach that goal I need proper schooling. I feel as though my education is what keeps me on the right track. I have ambition to get to college one day and this ambition helps me stay focused and do well in school. I know that the more education you have the better your career will be so I feel that working very hard right now will most definitely pay off in the long run. With education I will be the hardworking person I was destined to be. <br /><br />
			I did my schooling from City Montessori Inter College, Lucknow. Teacher taught us a very basic lesson of life and building a great career. I am currently a student of Department of Mathematics, IIT Kharagpur. Education for a kid is like pillars for a building, and I want to make sure my pillar don't withdraw support at times of adversity.</p> <hr />
